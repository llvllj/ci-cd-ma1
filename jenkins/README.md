# CI Pipeline Setup with Jenkins and Codacy

Welcome to our Jenkins CI pipeline sample repository! In this repository, we aim to demonstrate how we can use Jenkins for implementing a CI pipeline, and integrate Codacy for static code analysis, all defined within a `Jenkinsfile`.

## What's Inside?

This repository contains a `Jenkinsfile` that describes a Jenkins pipeline for a Maven-based Java project. The pipeline is split into three stages:

1. `Checkout`: Retrieves the code from a Git repository.
2. `Build & Test`: Compiles the code, runs tests, and then publishes the JUnit test results and JaCoCo code coverage reports.
3. `Codacy Analysis`: Runs a Codacy static code analysis on the codebase, helping us identify code quality issues and potential security vulnerabilities.

## How Codacy Fits In

We use Codacy, a code quality tool, to provide automated code reviews and feedback on the code changes introduced in each pull request. It helps us catch common code style, security, duplication, complexity, and performance issues that could be easily missed during a manual review.

After the code gets compiled and tested, the pipeline generates a code coverage report using JaCoCo and uploads this report to Codacy. Codacy then performs static code analysis and provides a report detailing any issues found, improving our code quality and making our pipeline even more robust.

## How to Use

First, make sure you have a Jenkins server up and running. If not, you can follow the official [Jenkins Installation Guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).

To set up a new Jenkins pipeline using this Jenkinsfile:

1. In Jenkins, create a new item, select `Pipeline`, and give it a name.
2. In the pipeline configuration, set the `Definition` to `Pipeline script from SCM`.
3. Set the `SCM` to `Git`.
4. Enter the repository URL and save your changes.

The pipeline will now run automatically whenever you push changes to your Git repository!

## Important Note

This is a sample Jenkinsfile and is meant for demonstrative purposes only, to showcase the skills involved in setting up a CI pipeline using Jenkins and integrating Codacy for static code analysis. Due to security considerations, it does not contain real project data, credentials, or any sensitive information.
Also, you should be mindful of securing your Jenkins setup by following best practices. This includes regularly updating Jenkins and its plugins, restricting access to Jenkins, and storing sensitive data (like credentials) securely using Jenkins Credentials plugin or a similar solution.

Happy coding!
