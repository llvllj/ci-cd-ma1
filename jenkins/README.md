# CI Pipeline Setup with Jenkins

Welcome to our Jenkins CI pipeline sample repository! This repository provides a glimpse into how we can leverage Jenkins for implementing a CI pipeline, using a `Jenkinsfile` to define the pipeline configuration.

## What's Inside?

This repository contains a `Jenkinsfile` which defines a basic Jenkins pipeline for a Maven-based Java project. The pipeline is divided into two stages:

1. `Checkout`: Checks out the code from a Git repository.
2. `Build & Test`: Compiles the code, runs tests, and then publishes the JUnit test results and JaCoCo code coverage reports.

## How to Use

Firstly, ensure that you have a Jenkins server up and running. If you don't, follow the official [Jenkins Installation Guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).

To set up a new Jenkins pipeline using this Jenkinsfile:

1. In Jenkins, create a new item, select `Pipeline`, and give it a name.
2. In the pipeline configuration, set the `Definition` to `Pipeline script from SCM`.
3. Set the `SCM` to `Git`.
4. Enter the repository URL and save your changes.

The pipeline will now run automatically whenever you push changes to your Git repository!

## Important Note

This is a sample Jenkinsfile and is meant for demonstrative purposes only, to showcase the skills involved in setting up a CI pipeline using Jenkins. Due to security considerations, it does not contain real project data, credentials, or any sensitive information.
Also, you should be mindful of securing your Jenkins setup by following best practices. This includes regularly updating Jenkins and its plugins, restricting access to Jenkins, and storing sensitive data (like credentials) securely using Jenkins Credentials plugin or a similar solution.

Happy coding!
